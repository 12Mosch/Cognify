# Forgetting Curve Optimized Learning Path

## Overview

The Forgetting Curve Optimized learning path is a new addition to the adaptive learning system that targets cards at optimal forgetting intervals based on individual retention patterns. This path maximizes retention efficiency by preventing over-studying and under-studying.

## Key Features

### üìâ Personal Forgetting Curve Analysis
- Calculates individual forgetting rates based on review history
- Analyzes retention patterns over time
- Adapts to personal learning characteristics

### ‚è∞ Optimal Timing Prediction
- Predicts the best time to review each card
- Balances retention vs. efficiency
- Prevents premature and delayed reviews

### üéØ Intelligent Prioritization
- Prioritizes cards approaching critical forgetting thresholds
- Considers personal learning patterns and inconsistencies
- Integrates with time-of-day optimization

## Algorithm Details

### Forgetting Curve Calculation

The algorithm calculates three key parameters for each card:

1. **Retention Rate**: Based on historical success patterns
2. **Forgetting Rate**: How quickly the user forgets information
3. **Stability Factor**: How stable the user's retention is over time

```typescript
interface ForgettingCurveData {
  retentionRate: number;    // 0-1, historical success rate
  forgettingRate: number;   // 0-1, speed of forgetting
  stabilityFactor: number;  // 0-2, retention stability
}
```

### Optimal Review Time

The optimal review time is calculated using:
- Current interval and ease factor (SM-2 base)
- Personal retention adjustment
- Forgetting rate compensation
- Stability factor modulation

### Forgetting Score

Cards are prioritized using a forgetting score that considers:
- **Early Review** (score < 0.5): Too early, low priority
- **Optimal Window** (score 0.5-1.0): Approaching optimal time
- **Overdue** (score > 1.0): Past optimal, high priority with decay

## Integration with Learning Patterns

### Personalization Boosts
- **Inconsistent Cards**: 1.5x boost for cards with variable performance
- **Plateau Topics**: 1.3x boost for stagnant learning areas
- **Time-of-Day**: 1.2x boost during optimal study times

### Learning Pattern Considerations
- Uses personal ease factor bias
- Considers learning velocity
- Adapts to time-of-day performance patterns

## Usage
