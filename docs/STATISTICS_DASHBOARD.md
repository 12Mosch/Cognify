# Statistics Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The Statistics Dashboard provides comprehensive analytics and insights for the flashcard learning app, offering users detailed visibility into their learning progress, performance metrics, and study patterns.

## Type Safety Improvements

### Interface Consolidation and Type Safety

The statistics dashboard components have been refactored to use consolidated, well-defined TypeScript interfaces that match the actual Convex query return structures, improving type safety and maintainability.

**Benefits:**
- **Consistent Type Definitions**: Centralized interfaces that match actual query return shapes
- **Improved Type Safety**: Proper handling of optional properties (`retentionRate?`, `averageInterval?`)
- **Better Developer Experience**: Clear TypeScript intellisense and error detection
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Shared interfaces across related components

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Consolidated type definitions that match Convex query structures
interface UserStats {
  totalDecks: number;
  totalCards: number;
  totalStudySessions: number;
  cardsStudiedToday: number;
  currentStreak: number;
  longestStreak: number;
  averageSessionDuration?: number;
  totalStudyTime?: number;
}

interface SpacedRepetitionInsights {
  totalDueCards: number;
  totalNewCards: number;
  cardsToReviewToday: number;
  upcomingReviews: Array<{
    date: string;
    count: number;
  }>;
  retentionRate?: number;
  averageInterval?: number;
}
```

**Refactored Components:**
- `StatisticsOverviewCards.tsx` - Now uses consolidated `UserStats` and `SpacedRepetitionInsights` interfaces
- `SpacedRepetitionInsights.tsx` - Now uses consolidated `SpacedRepetitionInsights` interface

**Note on Type Inference:**
While we initially attempted to use Convex's `FunctionReturnType` utility for automatic type inference, we discovered that the current implementation sets some optional properties (like `retentionRate`) to explicit `undefined` values, which causes TypeScript to infer them as `never` type instead of `number | undefined`. The manual interface approach provides better type safety and developer experience in this case.

## Key Components

### ChartWidget
Reusable container component that eliminates code duplication across chart components:

**Features:**
- **Consistent Styling**: Standardized dark theme with slate colors and responsive design
- **Flexible Structure**: Configurable title, subtitle, header actions, and footer content
- **Customizable Height**: Adjustable chart container height (default: h-80)
- **Accessibility**: Proper heading structure and semantic markup
