# Privacy Settings State Synchronization Fix

## Issue
The `PrivacySettings` component was not properly synchronizing its local state when external privacy settings changed. The `localSettings` state was initialized once from `privacySettings` but never updated when the external settings changed elsewhere in the application.

## Problem Description
When a user changed consent settings in one part of the application and then reopened the Privacy Settings modal, the modal would display stale values instead of the current privacy settings. This created a confusing user experience where the modal didn't reflect the actual current state.

## Solution
Added a `useEffect` hook to synchronize the local state whenever the external `privacySettings` change:

```typescript
// Sync local state when external privacy settings change
useEffect(() => {
  setLocalSettings(privacySettings);
}, [privacySettings]);
```

## Implementation Details

### Before
```typescript
export default function PrivacySettings({ isOpen, onClose }: PrivacySettingsProps) {
  const { privacySettings, grantConsent, revokeConsent } = usePrivacyCompliantAnalytics();
  const [localSettings, setLocalSettings] = useState<PrivacySettingsType>(privacySettings);
  // localSettings was never updated after initialization
}
```

### After
```typescript
export default function PrivacySettings({ isOpen, onClose }: PrivacySettingsProps) {
  const { privacySettings, grantConsent, revokeConsent } = usePrivacyCompliantAnalytics();
  const [localSettings, setLocalSettings] = useState<PrivacySettingsType>(privacySettings);

  // Sync local state when external privacy settings change
  useEffect(() => {
    setLocalSettings(privacySettings);
  }, [privacySettings]);
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Consistent UI State**: The modal always displays the current privacy settings
2. **Better UX**: Users see accurate information when reopening the modal
3. **Reactive Updates**: Local state automatically updates when external settings change
4. **No Breaking Changes**: The fix is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing functionality

## Files Modified
- `src/components/PrivacySettings.tsx`: Added `useEffect` import and state synchronization logic

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Linting passes without issues
- The component now properly reflects external privacy setting changes

## Related Components
This fix works in conjunction with:
- `usePrivacyCompliantAnalytics` hook from `src/lib/analytics.ts`
- `PrivacyBanner` component for initial consent collection
- Privacy settings storage and retrieval functions

## Future Considerations
This pattern should be applied to other components that maintain local state derived from external sources to ensure consistent UI behavior across the application.
