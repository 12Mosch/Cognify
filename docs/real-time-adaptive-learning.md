# Real-Time Adaptive Learning System

## Overview

The Real-Time Adaptive Learning System is a comprehensive enhancement to the flashcard app that provides immediate, personalized learning experiences by analyzing user interactions in real-time and dynamically adjusting study paths, difficulty levels, and recommendations.

## Key Features

### 1. Immediate Pattern Updates
- **Real-time interaction recording**: Every card flip, answer, confidence rating, and difficulty rating is immediately captured
- **Debounced pattern updates**: Learning patterns are updated efficiently without overwhelming the database
- **Incremental calculations**: Only changed data is processed, maintaining performance
- **Session-based tracking**: Interactions are grouped by study sessions for contextual analysis

### 2. Granular Mastery Tracking
- **Concept-level mastery**: Individual concepts are extracted from card content and tracked separately
- **Domain performance trends**: Performance is analyzed across different knowledge domains
- **Cross-concept relationships**: The system identifies prerequisites and related concepts
- **Mastery categories**: Concepts are classified as beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert level

### 3. Dynamic Path Regeneration
- **Significant change detection**: The system monitors for meaningful performance changes
- **Immediate recalculation**: Study paths are regenerated when patterns change significantly
- **Weighted prioritization**: Recent performance data is weighted more heavily than historical data
- **Session-aware adjustments**: Card priorities are adjusted within the current study session

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Intelligent caching**: Frequently accessed learning patterns are cached for fast retrieval
- **Batch processing**: Multiple interactions are processed together for efficiency
- **Debounced operations**: Database writes are optimized to prevent excessive operations
- **Performance monitoring**: System performance is tracked and optimized continuously

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { useRealTimeAdaptiveLearning } from '../hooks/useRealTimeAdaptiveLearning';

function StudyComponent({ deckId }: { deckId: string }) {
  const {
    recordFlip,
    recordConfidenceRating,
    reviewCard,
    adaptiveStudyQueue,
    studyRecommendations,
    priorityRecommendations,
    isProcessing
  } = useRealTimeAdaptiveLearning({
    deckId,
    sessionId: 'my-study-session',
    enableAutoOptimization: true,
    enableRecommendations: true
  });

  const handleCardFlip = async (cardId: string, responseTime: number) => {
    await recordFlip(cardId, responseTime, {
      cardIndex: currentIndex,
      totalCards: totalCards,
      studyMode: 'adaptive-spaced-repetition'
    });
  };

  const handleCardReview = async (cardId: string, quality: number) => {
    const result = await reviewCard(cardId, quality, {
      responseTime: responseTime,
      confidenceLevel: confidenceLevel
    });
    
    if (result?.adaptiveEnhancements) {
      console.log('Adaptive enhancements applied:', result.adaptiveEnhancements);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Study interface */}
      {priorityRecommendations.map(rec => (
        <div key={rec.type}>
          <h3>{rec.title}</h3>
          <p>{rec.description}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
// Custom optimization settings
const adaptiveLearning = useRealTimeAdaptiveLearning({
  deckId,
  sessionId: `session_${Date.now()}`,
  enableAutoOptimization: true,
  enableRecommendations: true,
  maxRecommendations: 10
});

// Manual optimization triggers
const handleOptimization = async () => {
  await adaptiveLearning.triggerBatchProcessing();
  await adaptiveLearning.refreshCache(true); // Force refresh
};
```
