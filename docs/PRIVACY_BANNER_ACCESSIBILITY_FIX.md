# Privacy Banner Accessibility Fix

## Issue
The `PrivacyBanner` component contained a blocking `alert()` call that created significant UX and accessibility problems:

- **Blocks main thread**: Synchronous alert prevents all user interaction
- **Impossible to style**: Browser alerts cannot be customized to match app theme
- **WCAG compliance failure**: Alerts fail color contrast and focus management guidelines
- **Poor mobile experience**: Browser alerts are particularly jarring on mobile devices

## Problem Description
When the Privacy Banner's "Customize" button was clicked but no `onSettingsClick` callback was provided, the component would fall back to showing a browser `alert()` with instructions to access privacy settings through the profile menu.

```typescript
// Before - Problematic code
alert('You can customize your privacy settings by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner and selecting "Privacy Settings".');
```

This created a poor user experience that:
1. Blocked all user interaction until dismissed
2. Couldn't be styled to match the app's dark/light theme
3. Failed accessibility guidelines for focus management
4. Provided no way to programmatically control or test the notification

## Solution
Replaced the blocking `alert()` with the existing toast notification system using `showInfoToast()`:

```typescript
// After - Accessible solution
showInfoToast('You can customize your privacy settings by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner and selecting "Privacy Settings".');
```

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. **Import toast helper**: Added `showInfoToast` import from `../lib/toast`
2. **Replace alert call**: Substituted `alert()` with `showInfoToast()` in the fallback branch

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Import added
import { showInfoToast } from '../lib/toast';

// In handleCustomize function
const handleCustomize = () => {
  if (onSettingsClick) {
    setShowBanner(false);
    onSettingsClick(handleSettingsClosed);
  } else {
    // Replaced alert() with accessible toast
    showInfoToast('You can customize your privacy settings by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner and selecting "Privacy Settings".');
  }
};
```

## Benefits

### Accessibility Improvements
- **WCAG Compliant**: Toast notifications include proper ARIA attributes (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`)
- **Non-blocking**: Users can continue interacting with the page while the notification is visible
- **Focus Management**: No disruptive focus changes or traps
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic markup for assistive technologies

### User Experience Improvements
- **Consistent Styling**: Toast matches app theme (dark/light mode support)
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Non-intrusive notification that doesn't block interaction
- **Automatic Dismissal**: Toast auto-dismisses after 4 seconds (configurable)
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches other notifications throughout the app

### Technical Benefits
- **Testable**: Toast notifications can be mocked and tested in unit tests
- **Configurable**: Duration, styling, and behavior can be customized
- **Maintainable**: Uses existing toast infrastructure instead of browser APIs

## Toast Configuration
The info toast uses the following configuration from `src/lib/toast.ts`:

```typescript
{
  duration: 4000, // 4 seconds
  icon: 'ℹ️',
  style: {
    background: '#3b82f6', // blue-500
    color: '#ffffff',
    fontWeight: '500',
  },
  ariaProps: {
    role: 'status',
    'aria-live': 'polite',
  },
}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/PrivacyBanner.tsx`: 
  - Added `showInfoToast` import
  - Replaced `alert()` call with `showInfoToast()` in `handleCustomize` function

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass (251/251)
- ✅ Linting passes without issues
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No breaking changes to component API

## Accessibility Compliance
This fix addresses several WCAG 2.1 guidelines:

- **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable**: Toast auto-dismisses but doesn't require immediate action
- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: No disruptive focus changes
- **3.2.1 On Focus**: No unexpected context changes when interacting with the banner
- **4.1.3 Status Messages**: Proper ARIA attributes for status announcements

## Related Components
This improvement works with:
- `src/lib/toast.ts`: Toast notification system
- `src/App.tsx`: Toast container configuration
- `react-hot-toast`: Underlying toast library

## Future Considerations
This pattern should be applied to any remaining `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()` calls throughout the application to maintain consistent accessibility standards.

## Browser Support
Toast notifications work across all modern browsers and provide graceful degradation for older browsers through the react-hot-toast library.
